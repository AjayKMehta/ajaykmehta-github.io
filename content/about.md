This is the personal blog of Ajay Mehta. For most of my career, I have worked as a technologist in the financial services industry. I currently work remotely for a software company in the Bay Area. In this blog, I will explore a variety of topics related to programming, data science, math and anything else that interests me. Opinions expressed are **solely** my own and **not** that of my employer.
