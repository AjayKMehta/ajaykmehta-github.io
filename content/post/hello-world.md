This is a test.

```haskell
m >>= f

foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl _ z [] = z
foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
```

```csharp
var x = new List<string>();
```

```r
iris %>%
group_by(Species) %>%
summarize(
    avg_length = mean(Sepal.Length),
    max_length = max(Sepal.Length)
)
```

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | group Name | ? Count -gt 1
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

$$\alpha = \frac{1}{3}$$
